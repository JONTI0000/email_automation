<p style="font-size:16px;">Dear {name}</p>

<div style="font-size:14px;" >
<p>
I am writing to you from bubltown. You may not have heard of us yet, but for the past 2 years, 
we've been working with local authorities in the UK to implement our global award-winning smart economy solution. 
</p>

<p>
With consecutive successes in our last few projects we have just begun to roll out globally,
we work with major UK councils such as Brent, Newcastle, Merton and Coventry to fuel economic
growth, support local businesses and grow local spend.
</p>

<p>
We would simply love the opportunity to discuss the possibility of proposing a project for your busines in {area}.
</p>

<p>
Might your diary allow for a brief introduction.
</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>
